,"Inflammatory carcinoma is a subtype of invasive ductal carcinoma, which is a type of breast cancer. Inflammatory carcinoma is characterized by cancer cells that block lymphatic vessels in the skin of the breast, causing the breast to become red, swollen, and warm to the touch. This type of cancer is called ""inflammatory"" because it can mimic the symptoms of an inflammatory response, such as an infection. Inflammatory carcinoma is often more aggressive than other types of breast cancer, and it may be more likely to spread to other parts of the body. Treatment for inflammatory carcinoma typically involves a combination of surgery, chemotherapy, and radiation therapy, as well as targeted therapies that are designed to attack specific proteins on the surface of cancer cells."," Inflammatory carcinoma is a type of breast cancer that has medullary features and often causes necrosis with chronic inflammation.

Vaginal exams may stimulate contractions and help with cervical dilation, ultimately leading to delivery if intervention is necessary..","The recommended approach for managing patients with false labor or Braxton-Hicks contractions is expectant management.

False labor, or Braxton-Hicks contractions, are common in pregnancy and can often be mistaken for true labor. Unlike true labor, false labor contractions are irregular, do not increase in intensity or frequency, and do not cause cervical dilation or effacement. In cases of false labor, expectant management is usually recommended. This means that the patient is closely monitored for any signs of true labor, such as regular contractions, cervical dilation, or ruptured membranes. If the patient is not in active labor, they are usually advised to rest, stay hydrated, and avoid activities that may trigger contractions. In some cases, medications such as tocolytics may be used to stop or slow down contractions.
