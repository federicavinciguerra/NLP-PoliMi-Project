Prostacyclin analogues are a class of medications that are used to treat pulmonary arterial hypertension, a condition in which the blood pressure in the arteries that supply the lungs is abnormally high. Prostacyclin analogues work by dilating the blood vessels in the lungs, which helps to reduce the workload on the heart and improve oxygenation. However, one of the potential side effects of these medications is jaw pain, which can be caused by the dilation of blood vessels in the jaw.

Platelet aggregation is the process by which platelets clump together to form a blood clot, which is important for preventing excessive bleeding. Prostacyclin analogs, such as epoprostenol and iloprost, can inhibit platelet aggregation by activating specific receptors on the platelet surface. In addition to their antiplatelet effects, prostacyclin analogs are also potent vasodilators, meaning that they can dilate blood vessels and increase blood flow. This is due to their ability to activate receptors on the smooth muscle cells that line blood vessels, causing them to relax and widen.
