        "  - **4-bit Quantization:** Enabled 4-bit quantization for loading the model.\n",
        "  - **Quantization Type:** Set the quantization type to \"nf4\", which stands for normal float 4-bit.\n",

        "### What is Quantization?\n",
        "Quantization is the process of mapping continuous values to a finite range of discrete values. In the context of neural networks, it involves reducing the precision of the weights and activations from higher bit-width (e.g., 32-bit floating point) to lower bit-width (e.g., 8-bit, 4-bit) representations. This process can significantly reduce the memory footprint and computational requirements of the model.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Why 4-bit Quantization?\n",
        "- **Memory Efficiency:** 4-bit quantization reduces the amount of memory needed to store the model parameters by a factor of 8 compared to 32-bit floating point representation.\n",
        "- **Computational Efficiency:** Operations on 4-bit quantized data are faster and require less power, making it ideal for deployment on resource-constrained devices such as mobile phones and embedded systems.\n",
        "- **Performance:** Advanced quantization techniques, like the one specified with \"nf4\" (normal float 4-bit), help maintain the model's performance close to that of the full-precision model while enjoying the benefits of reduced resource usage.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Result\n",
        "- The configuration prepares the model to be loaded with 4-bit quantization, optimizing both memory usage and computational efficiency while maintaining performance.\n",
        "\n",
        "This setup is particularly useful when working with large models or deploying them on resource-constrained environments."

        "## Purpose\n",
        "- To configure LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation) parameters for fine-tuning a pre-trained language model efficiently.\n",
        "\n",
        "## What is LoRA?\n",
        "LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation) is a technique used to adapt large pre-trained models to specific tasks without updating all the parameters of the model. Instead, LoRA introduces additional trainable parameters in the form of low-rank matrices, significantly reducing the number of parameters that need to be updated during fine-tuning. This method maintains the performance of the original model while greatly improving computational efficiency.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Steps Involved\n",
        "\n",
        "### 1. Configure LoRA Parameters\n",
        "- **r:** The rank of the low-rank matrices. A higher rank allows for more expressive power but increases the number of trainable parameters. Here, it is set to 16.\n",
        "- **lora_alpha:** The scaling factor for the low-rank matrices. It controls the contribution of the low-rank matrices to the overall adaptation. Here, it is set to 32.\n",
        "- **target_modules:** Specifies which modules within the model should be adapted using LoRA. In this case, the query (`q`) and value (`v`) projection matrices of the attention mechanism are targeted.\n",
        "- **lora_dropout:** Dropout rate for the LoRA layers to prevent overfitting during fine-tuning. Here, it is set to 0.05.\n",
        "- **bias:** Specifies how biases should be treated in the adaptation process. It is set to `\"none\"`, meaning no biases are adapted.\n",
        "- **task_type:** Indicates the type of task the model is being fine-tuned for. In this case, it is set to `TaskType.SEQ_2_SEQ_LM` (sequence-to-sequence language modeling), which is suitable for tasks like text generation and machine translation.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Benefits of Using LoRA\n",
        "- **Parameter Efficiency:** LoRA significantly reduces the number of parameters that need to be fine-tuned, making the process more efficient.\n",
        "- **Reduced Computational Resources:** By updating only a small subset of parameters, LoRA lowers the computational requirements, enabling the fine-tuning of large models on limited hardware.\n",
        "- **Maintained Performance:** Despite the reduced parameter updates, LoRA maintains the performance of the original model, ensuring high-quality results.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Result\n",
        "- Configured LoRA parameters are ready to be applied to the model for efficient and effective fine-tuning."

        "\n",

        "\n",

            "When a patient is unconscious and has impaired respiratory status, it is important to establish and maintain a patent airway in order to ensure adequate oxygenation and ventilation. However, in patients with suspected cervical fractures, airway management can be challenging due to the need to maintain cervical spine immobilization. Rapid sequence intubation (RSI) is a recommended airway management technique in these patients, as it allows for rapid and safe intubation while minimizing movement of the cervical spine. RSI involves the use of sedatives and neuromuscular blocking agents to facilitate intubation, followed by confirmation of proper tube placement and initiation of mechanical ventilation. RSI should only be performed by trained healthcare professionals who are familiar with the technique and its potential complications. Other airway management techniques that may be used in certain situations include bag-mask ventilation, cricothyrotomy, and/or needle cricothyrotomy.\n",

This type of melanoma typically begins as a flat, irregularly shaped lesion on the skin that slowly grows and spreads over time. Superficial spreading melanoma usually develops on the legs or back in women, and on the back or chest in men. It can occur at any age, but it is most commonly diagnosed in people in their 40s and 50s. Superficial spreading melanoma is usually treatable if caught early, but it can be deadly if it spreads to other parts of the body. Therefore, it is important to have any suspicious moles or lesions on the skin checked by a dermatologist.\n",
